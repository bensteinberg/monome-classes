monome-classes
==============
MonomeGrid.ck contains a class for using a monome grid in ChucK.  It
is derived from the LicK Library's
[Monome.ck](https://github.com/heuermh/lick/blob/master/Monome.ck) and
Raymond Weiterkamp's
[monomeclass0.4.ck](http://monome.org/docs/_media/app:monomeclass0.4.ck.zip),
but communicates with the grid via serialosc and uses the current
(late 2013) OSC messages.  It does not yet handle tilt or
varibrightness. 

This file will be joined shortly by MonomeArc.ck and examples of use.
